## Ongoing Research Projects

### Hierarchical Hybrid Workload Orchestration for Edge–Fog–Cloud CDN
*In Progress*

Designing a multi-timescale forecasting and provisioning framework for CDN traffic using edge burst detection, fog-level mixture-of-experts forecasting, and cloud-assisted continual learning. Aims to reduce SLA violations, latency, and operational cost under non-stationary workloads.

### Fast–Accurate Online Learning for Edge AI
*In Progress*

Developing a lightweight online learning algorithm that bridges the speed–accuracy gap between OS-ELM and OR-ELM. Enables stable edge inference under drift and bursty workloads for Edge AI applications.

## Undergraduate Thesis

### Sentiment Analysis from a Bengali Dataset Using Hybrid Deep Learning and Contextualized Word Embedding Techniques
*2024*

Utilized contextualized Bangla BERT word embedding techniques to replace traditional methods (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) combined with a CNN-BiLSTM model, achieving **96.84% accuracy**. Compared performance with 8 machine learning and 2 deep learning models, and introduced a feature for expressing sentiment with relative sentiment scores.
