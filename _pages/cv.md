## Publications

### **PriBan: A Benchmark Dataset and Modeling Framework for Privacy Preservation in Bengali Texts**    
*ICCIT 2025 | 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology
- Developed a benchmark dataset and framework to preserve user privacy during interactions with large language models, addressing the tendency of LLMs to inadvertently leak sensitive information, with a specific focus on the Bangla language.

## Ongoing Research Projects

### **Hierarchical Hybrid Workload Orchestration for Edge–Fog–Cloud CDN**    
*In Progress
- Designing a multi-timescale forecasting and provisioning framework for CDN traffic using edge burst detection, fog-level mixture-of-experts forecasting, and cloud-assisted continual learning. Aims to reduce SLA violations, latency, and operational cost under non-stationary workloads.

### **Fast–Accurate Online Learning for Edge AI**    
*In Progress
- Developing a lightweight online learning algorithm that bridges the speed–accuracy gap between OS-ELM and OR-ELM. Enables stable edge inference under drift and bursty workloads for Edge AI applications.

## Thesis

### **Sentiment Analysis from a Bengali Dataset Using Hybrid Deep Learning and Contextualized Word Embedding Techniques**    
- Utilized contextualized Bangla BERT word embedding techniques to replace traditional methods (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) combined with a CNN-BiLSTM model, achieving 96.84% accuracy.
- Compared performance with 8 machine learning and 2 deep learning models, and introduced a feature for expressing sentiment with relative sentiment scores.

## Undergraduate Projects


### **Intelligent Information Retrieval via Question Answering**   
*Knowledge Graphs, Graph Neural Networks, Semantic Reasoning*  
- Explored intelligent information retrieval through question answering by leveraging knowledge graphs and graph neural networks. Incorporated structured semantic relationships and graph-based reasoning to challenge conventional models for improved accuracy and interpretability.
  
### **Accident Detection and Developing an Alert System Using Deep Learning**   
*Deep Learning, Computer Vision, GPS Integration, Real-time Detection*  
- Developed a system to detect accidents from CCTV camera video footage with an integrated alert system. Incorporated GPS functionality to inform authorities about accident locations. Capable of detecting accidents from both live camera feeds and stored footage.

### **Pneumonia Detection from X-ray Images with Deep Learning** 
*CNN, VGG-16, Transfer Learning, Medical Image Classification*  
- Built a conventional CNN model to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. Implemented and compared performance with pre-trained VGG-16 model to classify chest X-rays as normal or pneumonia-positive.
  
### **Language Translator using Seq2Seq Model**  
*Encoder-Decoder, Seq2Seq, NLP, Machine Translation*  
- Designed a French-to-English language translator using an Encoder-Decoder seq2seq architecture. Performed extensive text preprocessing and cleaning to optimize translation accuracy.
