### **Pneumonia Detection from X-ray Images with Deep Learning** 
*CNN, VGG-16, Transfer Learning, Medical Image Classification*  
- Built a conventional CNN model to accurately detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. Implemented and compared performance with pre-trained VGG-16 model to classify chest X-rays as normal or pneumonia-positive.
